## Project 4: Etch-a-Sketch

It's a practice to build a Etch-a-Sketch game board using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In detail, the result is a space divided into (N X N) grids, and the grids change color if your mouse passes over them.
You can press the `Resize` button to refresh the colored grids and change the number of grid in each side.
